# Quantitative Logistics


This repository contains the code for seminar and lecture homework assignments related to quantitative logistics. It includes implementations of various algorithms such as genetic algorithm and simulated annealing (SA) in Python.


## Introduction

Quantitative logistics is the application of mathematical and computational methods to solve logistical problems efficiently. This repository serves as a collection of code examples and implementations for various algorithms used in quantitative logistics.

## Algorithms Implemented

The following algorithms have been implemented in Python:

1. Genetic Algorithm: The genetic algorithm is a search heuristic inspired by the process of natural selection. It is commonly used to optimize problems with a large search space and complex constraints.

2. Simulated Annealing (SA): Simulated annealing is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. It is particularly useful for optimization problems where finding the exact solution is impractical.
